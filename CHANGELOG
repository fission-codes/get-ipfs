Allows you to define your own version of js-ipfs instead of the predefined fallback. Before it would load js-ipfs v0.38, now it loads the latest version from unpkg by default, which you can override as follows using this configuration property:

```
jsIpfs: "https://unpkg.com/ipfs@latest/dist/index.min.js",
jsIpfs: async () => await import("ipfs"),
jsIpfs: () => Promise.resolve(Ipfs)
```
