A one-stop shop for loading an ipfs instance into a webpage.

Attempts to load ipfs in the following order and returns the result in a Promise:
1. `window.ipfs.enable`: the current `window.ipfs` api. Available if the user is using Opera or has the ipfs-companion extension installed.
2. `window.ipfs`: the old `window.ipfs` api. Does not include enabling permissions all at once.
3. `js-ipfs`: an in-browser ipfs node that communicates via WebRTC/Websockets. The `js-ipfs` code is only loaded if required. 


## Usage
```
import getIpfs from 'get-ipfs'

const ipfs = await getIpfs([config])
```

### Config 
```
{
  // `permissions` are enabled if the browser is ipfs-capable (Opera or extension)
  // passed to `window.ipfs.enable` if available
  // prevents a permission dialog from appearing for every action
  permissions: ['id', 'version', 'add', 'cat', 'dag'],

  // `bootstrap` is a list of peers to be added to the node's bootstrap list
  // to work with the `js-ipfs` fallback, these must have available websocket ports
  bootstrap: []
}
```

## Testing
### Tests coming soon!!
- Run `npm i`
- Run tests with: `npm run test`
- Continuously watch with `npm run test:watch`

## Notes
This repo currently makes use of types from [typestub-ipfs](https://github.com/beenotung/typestub-ipfs). 

Give your support [here](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/1166) for types to be merged into `js-ipfs` or `DefinitelyTyped`.
