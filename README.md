Utility to get js-ipfs with fallbacks

## To Use
```
import getIpfs from 'get-ipfs'

const ipfs = await getIpfs([config])
```

### Config 
```
{
  // `permissions` are enabled if the browser is ipfs-capable (Opera or extension)
  // passed to `window.ipfs.enable`
  // prevents a permission dialog from appearing for every action
  permissions: ['id', 'version', 'add', 'cat', 'dag'],

  // `bootstrap` is a list of peers to be added to the node's bootstrap list
  // to work with the `js-ipfs` fallback, these must have available websocket ports
  bootstrap: []
}
```

## Testing
### Tests coming soon!!
- Run `npm i`
- Run tests with: `npm run test`
- Continuously watch with `npm run test:watch`
